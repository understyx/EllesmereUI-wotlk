--  EllesmereUIQuickdraw.lua  --  hold-to-open action palette for EllesmereUI
--
--  Hold a keybind -> a set of slots appears. Choose one, release the key to
--  fire it. Releasing without having chosen cancels, and so does ESCAPE, which
--  every layout answers to for as long as it is open.
--
--  One palette of actions, drawn and steered three ways:
--
--    ARC     entries spread over `arcSpan` degrees, steered by the ANGLE from
--            the centre. The sectors are unbounded in depth, so the gesture is
--            a flick rather than a click. A span of 360 is the whole turn.
--    FAN     a strip running along one axis, horizontal or vertical by
--            `fanOrientation`. Scroll-steered it cycles a compressed window
--            past a fixed centre; pointer-steered it is a GRID one entry deep.
--    GRID    every entry at a fixed cell, the nearest one zoomed.
--
--  The layouts differ in INPUT MODEL -- angle, scroll-cycle, pointer-nearest --
--  which is why they are separate rather than parameters of one another. The
--  span is the exception: it is a parameter of the angular model, so the full
--  turn the module opened life as is simply the arc's 360-degree case.
--
--  Each palette owns one hidden SecureActionButtonTemplate button; the palette's
--  keybind is routed to it with SetOverrideBindingClick -- along with every
--  modifier combination of that key nothing else holds, so a modifier pressed
--  or let go during the hold still reaches the button (see "Modifier variants
--  of a palette's key") -- and it is registered for "AnyDown","AnyUp":
--
--    key DOWN -> our PreClick opens the palette; a secure snippet wrapped around
--                OnClick clears "type", so the press itself fires nothing
--    key UP   -> the snippet works out which entry the cursor is on and writes
--                that slot's action attributes, the secure handler performs the
--                cast, and our PostClick closes the palette
--
--  The choosing has to happen inside the snippet because an addon may not write
--  attributes to a protected frame during combat -- see the Secure activation
--  section for the blocked-action this design was built around. Only the
--  angular layouts are steered in the snippet so far; the others still commit
--  from Lua and therefore only fire out of combat.
--
--  Protected calls in this file, all of them deferred to PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED
--  when in combat: the override-binding updates, and PushPalette's writes of a
--  palette's contents onto the secure buttons.

-- CreateLiveView is reached from OnEnable, which runs under the parent's
-- lifecycle dispatch, so a frame made there is stamped EllesmereUI for the
-- session. This frame carries OnPaletteUpdate. Made there, every frame of
-- steering and hit testing an open palette does was billed to the parent addon
-- instead of to this one, which hid the cost of the module that causes it. The
-- main chunk runs as this addon, so the frame is stamped correctly here.

-- what builds a palette's secure button, so the ones left unbound cost nothing.
local MAX_PALETTES = 16

-- Entries one menu may hold. Twelve was what a ring of the SETTING'S OWN
-- radius could seat without its entries touching -- at the shipped 100 and a
-- 50-unit pitch, the thirteenth overlaps its neighbour. That is no longer the
-- constraint: Menu Radius is a minimum now and the ring grows with the count
-- (see PaletteView:Geom), so the cap answers to how many entries a person can
-- still aim at rather than to how many fit. Sixteen, which is where a full
-- circle gives each entry 22.5 degrees.
local MAX_SLOTS = 16

-- Entries a nested palette contributes through a HALO, which is eight fixed
-- positions around a cell (see HALO_DIRS) and so cannot seat a ninth child
-- without a second ring it has no room for. This is a real limit of that one
-- shape, not a readability judgement.
--
-- The arc used to share it and no longer does: an arc claim RINGS its children
-- and spills into further rings as they crowd (see ChildGeom and
-- MAX_CHILD_ROWS), so its ground grows with the count exactly as the palette's
-- own ring does. It seats a nested palette whole, like every other layout.
-- See NestChildCap, which is where the per-layout answer lives.
local MAX_CHILDREN = 8

-- How many concentric rings a nested arc's children may spill into before a
-- crowded claim just packs its last ring tighter than one child pitch. More
-- children than the span cap can hold are answered by adding a ring one child
-- pitch further out (see ChildGeom), not by pushing the existing ring out to
-- some unbounded radius. The cap keeps that answer
-- bounded on both sides: the live view and the snippet only ever carry
-- MAX_CHILD_ROWS worth of ring attributes, so a claim that would need a fifth
-- ring degrades by crowding the fourth instead of drifting the two out of
-- step with each other.
local MAX_CHILD_ROWS = 4

-- How many rect gates a single claim's REGION may be built from. One box
-- (HALO, whose ring already sits close enough round its parent that the old
-- bounding box was the true shape), three for a nest that sits in one piece
-- off one side of the block (the parent's own cell, the nest's own tight box,
-- and a corridor one child cell wide connecting them), and five for a lane
-- with the block to itself: the parent's cell plus one box per side of the
-- block its run reached, and a full run can wrap onto all four. One
-- box across the lot instead would swallow the block's own corner ground --
-- see PerimeterNest, the "Arming gates" section and RunReach below.
--
-- Fourteen is what a lane sharing the block with OTHER claims comes to. Each of
-- those has its own cell taken out of this claim's coverage (see ParentHoles),
-- which splits the side it falls on into at most a slab clear of it and one
-- interval reaching back to the parent -- the pieces past it are dropped, being
-- ground this claim cannot be armed on anyway.
--
-- Derived by running .tools/quickdraw-nest over every block layout at
-- MAX_SLOTS: 330,692 arrangements -- 2 to 16 entries, every arrangement of up
-- to four nesting ones (thinned evenly past 120 per shape), 1 to 16 children
-- each, auto and pinned columns, both nest styles. Fourteen covers all but 239
-- of them; the worst single claim in the sweep comes to eighteen, and spending
-- four more gates and eight more wrapped scripts on every claim to catch that
-- last 0.07 per cent is not the trade. Past the budget the tail is dropped,
-- child-bearing pieces being written first, so a claim that does overflow loses
-- ground between its entries rather than a child.
--
-- Re-run that sweep if MAX_SLOTS, MAX_CHILDREN or any nest geometry moves --
-- this number is an OUTPUT of the shapes below it, not a choice.
local REGION_MAX = 14

-- How many drawn positions the scroll strip's arming lattice may span each

--
--  Everything under DB_DEFAULTS.profile lives in the suite's central store, at

--  EllesmereUI.Lite.NewDB). That placement is the whole profile integration:
--  the data follows whichever profile the character resolves to, a profile
--  swap or import repoints db.profile and reaches _EQD_Apply through
--  RefreshAllAddons (EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua:1433), and profile export and
--  import carry the table because the module is listed in ADDON_DB_MAP
--  (EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua:83). A new setting only needs a default here to
--  be per-profile and exportable -- there is nothing else to register.
--
--  Two kinds of state must NOT be added under profile: per-character or
--  account-wide state (keybinds, for example, stay in WoW's binding system),
--  and anything read outside db.profile through a cached reference (P() is
--  the accessor that stays correct across a swap). If the module ever grows
--  unlock-anchored elements, their key prefix must also be added to
--  KEY_PREFIX_FOLDER in EllesmereUI_Profiles.lua.

-- One rect covering a nest run AND the ground between it and the parent's own

-- the parent cell diagonally, and a claim with one corridor pointing at one side
-- loses the cursor the moment it aims at another -- without spending a region
-- gate per side on the corridors alone.
--
-- The PARENT'S OWN CELL folded in, rather than a corridor drawn between the two:
-- a rect is convex, so a rect holding both ends of a line holds every point of
-- it, and a reach IS a line -- a hand goes straight at the icon it wants. Any
-- corridor narrower than that leaves some straight reach crossing ground the
-- claim does not hold, however carefully it is aimed: a corridor laid across the
-- gap the two boxes leave in ONE direction is exited by a reach that leaves the
-- parent cell through a different edge.
--
-- What it costs is honest: the sweep from the parent's cell out to a run stands
-- over whatever plain entries lie in it -- for a parent in the middle of a block
-- the ones between it and its lane, which the corridor this replaces covered too
-- (that was as wide as the whole nest), and for a parent on the block's own edge

-- worse than a nest that stays up one entry too long: the break does not cancel
-- anything, it fires whatever the cursor came to rest over instead.
--
-- One kind of entry in that sweep IS allowed to back the nest out: another
-- claim's own entry, which the sweep would otherwise make unreachable while this
-- claim is armed -- its parent gate being dark the whole time. Those cells are

-- Redraw the cells whose icon can move, if anything they follow has moved since
-- the last time this asked.
--
-- The palette fires on the RELEASE, and both of these kinds decide what they
-- cast at that moment: a macro's conditionals are evaluated then, and a Dynamic
-- Rez picks its branch then. So the player can press a modifier, pull a boss or
-- click a corpse at any point during the hold and change what the entry under
-- the cursor is going to do. Without this the palette keeps drawing whichever
-- branch happened to be current when it opened, and the only way to find out
-- that it swapped is to fire it.
--
-- A latched menu makes this matter more than a hold does: it stays up across a
-- pull, which is exactly the transition the rez branches on.
--
-- ICON only, deliberately. The label stays the name the paint gave it -- for a
-- macro that is the macro's own name, which is what Blizzard's action buttons
-- show and what the player recognises -- and the usability tint stays where the
-- paint left it, for the reason PaintCell gives: a colour that moves under a
-- settled hand reads as a flicker.
--
-- Five C calls per frame for a palette holding one of these kinds, none for one
-- that is not (the list is empty and this returns on the first line), and
-- textures are touched only on the frames the state actually changes -- one
-- press of shift, not one per frame it stays down.
-- The pip that says this world marker is down right now, so an entry says
-- whether pressing it places the marker or picks it back up before it is
-- pressed. Blizzard's own manager draws the same distinction, swapping its
-- button art between "applied" and "available"
-- (Mainline/Blizzard_CompactRaidFrameManager.lua:1107-1112).
--
-- Read on every open, which is where nearly all of its value is: firing an
-- entry closes the menu (see the release handler), so a press never updates a
-- pip the presser can still see.
--
-- IsRaidMarkerActive is unrestricted and answers a plain bool -- it is neither
-- protected nor a secret value, unlike GetRaidTargetIndex beside it in the
-- documentation -- so this reads the same in combat as out of it.
--
-- Every other kind hides the pip rather than leaving it alone: one widget is
-- reused for whatever the next open puts in it, and a stale pip would claim a
-- spell was a marker that is on the ground.

-- Which slot a release fires is decided by where the cursor is at that instant,
-- so the decision cannot be made in Lua. Writing the chosen action onto the
-- button from an insecure PreClick fails as soon as the player is in combat:
--
--   ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED  tried to call the protected function
--   'EUIQuickdrawButton1:SetAttribute()'
--
-- Note that SimpleFrameAPIDocumentation.lua does NOT flag
-- SetAttribute with IsProtectedFunction the way it flags ClearAttribute: that
-- flag marks methods that are protected unconditionally, and says nothing about
-- the separate rule that bites here -- a protected frame, written by tainted
-- code, during combat. Do not move this back into Lua on the strength of it.
--
-- So the choosing happens inside a secure snippet. Code in the restricted
-- environment is secure, and its SetAttribute calls are not blocked. Everything
-- the snippet needs is pushed onto the button as ordinary attributes while out
-- of combat, including the arc geometry ArcGeom already works out -- the snippet
-- does no layout maths of its own, which is what stops it drifting away from
-- HitTest as the layout options change.
--
-- A snippet body is compiled against a fixed parameter list, not as a vararg
-- function: Wrapped_Click builds the pre-body with the signature
-- "self,button,down" and the post-body with "self,message,button,down"
-- (SecureHandlers.lua:275,287). So those names are already locals here, and
-- `local button, down = ...` is a compile error -- "cannot use '...' outside a
-- vararg function" -- which surfaces only when the snippet first runs in-game.
--
-- The sandbox has no GetCursorPosition, so the cursor is read with
-- GetMousePosition on a frame handle. That measures against UIParent, NOT
-- against the palette, for two independent reasons:
--
--   * GetMousePosition goes through GetHandleFrame, which refuses a handle to an
--     unprotected frame while in combat (RestrictedFrames.lua:84). The palette is
--     an ordinary addon frame, so its handle is rejected exactly when we need it.
--   * It returns nil when the cursor lies outside the frame's rect
--     (RestrictedFrames.lua:317). Layout sizes the palette to a finite box
--     around its entries, so measuring against it would put a hard edge on a
--     gesture that is deliberately unbounded in depth: a long flick would
--     highlight an entry and then fire nothing. Against a fixed-position
--     palette the cursor could
--     start outside that box entirely.
--
-- UIParent is protected, covers the screen, and never moves. The palette's centre
-- is therefore derived rather than measured: in fixed-position mode it is
-- UIParent's centre plus the configured offset, and in cursor mode it is
-- wherever the cursor was when the palette opened -- which is the position the
-- press captured, since PositionPalette ran in our PreClick just before this.
--
-- GetMousePosition reports a [0,1] fraction of the frame measured from its
-- bottom-left, so scaling by UIParent's size gives UIParent units, and dividing
-- by the palette's own scale converts to the units radius and deadZone use.
-- sqrt is not on the sandbox whitelist; ^0.5 is the same thing.
--
-- All angles in here are DEGREES, and the step and start are handed over
-- already converted. The sandbox's atan2 is WoW's global one, which answers in
-- degrees; math.atan2, which HitTest upvalues, answers in radians. Working in
-- degrees also means the wrap is an exact 360 rather than a written-out 2*pi
-- (`pi` is not on the whitelist), which removes a real trap: a 2*pi literal
-- short by 1e-13 disagrees with HitTest's math.pi*2 often enough to land the
-- other side of the +0.5 rounding on an entry boundary.

--  Arming gates -- the pass-through rule, and the exclusive-ground rule
--
--  A nest's cells only answer a release once the cursor has actually entered
--  the claim's own parent entry, and stop answering only once it has left
--  the claim's WHOLE ground -- parent cell, nest, and the corridor between --
--  not merely one rect of it. That is state that has to survive the entire
--  hold, which the release snippet cannot do on its own -- it only ever sees
--  the final position -- so it is kept on the secure button itself, as
--  eqdArmed, and maintained by protected frames per claim reacting to real
--  mouse movement:
--
--    PARENT gate    covers the claim's own entry. OnEnter arms the claim,
--                   hides every OTHER claim's parent gate (block layouts
--                   only -- see below), and shows this claim's REGION gates.
--    REGION gates    up to REGION_MAX rects covering the claim's ground -- see
--                   CorridorBox and CellChildGeom/ChildGeom for what
--                   they are. An arc's ground is a wedge rather than a set of
--                   rects, so there its rects are event surfaces only and the
--                   test below is polar. OnLeave of ANY of them does NOT blindly
--                   disarm: moving between two of a claim's own region rects
--                   also fires OnLeave (see below), so the snippet instead
--                   measures the cursor against the claim's FULL region,
--                   geometrically, and disarms only when it is genuinely
--                   outside all of it. Disarming re-shows every OTHER
--                   claim's parent gate and hides this claim's own regions.
--
--  Parent gates sit at a HIGHER frame level than region gates, and every
--  region gate of a claim sits at the SAME level as its siblings. WoW's mouse
--  focus is exclusive and topmost-wins -- exactly one frame holds it at a
--  time -- which is what both rules lean on:
--
--    Exclusive arming, in the BLOCK layouts.  While claim A is armed, every
--    OTHER claim's parent gate is hidden, so brushing past a neighbour's cell
--    cannot steal focus from A's own ground no matter how close the two sit.
--    A hidden gate cannot receive
--    OnEnter, so B stays unarmable until A's OnLeave test actually disarms it
--    and re-shows B's gate.
--
--    The ARC does the opposite and leaves them alight, because there the two
--    grounds do not interleave: a claim's children sit radially outside the
--    entry ring, and its ground clears the neighbouring entries' own centres
--    (see ChildGeom). What it cannot do is cover that ground with rects -- the
--    ground is a wedge -- so a cursor that has left every rect of A while
--    still on A's ground has nothing left to fire the leave test again, and
--    hiding B's gate as well would leave A armed over the entry the cursor
--    finally stopped on. That is also the one place the two layouts' promises
--    differ: on the arc a claim can stay armed over a PLAIN entry, which
--    leaves its nest drawn open a moment too long and costs the release
--    nothing (the release never consults eqdArmed inside the entry ring).
--
--    Geometric arming, at the two moments a gate is SHOWN. Show() does not
--    synthesise a motion event, so a gate that comes up under a cursor
--    already inside it raises no OnEnter at all until the cursor leaves and
--    comes back -- and both of the moments gates are shown are moments the
--    cursor is very likely already on one. In cursor mode the palette opens
--    centred on the pointer, so a middle cell's gate is under it at every
--    single press; and a disarm re-shows every parent gate, possibly beneath
--    a cursor that has already arrived on another claim's entry. Left to the
--    OnEnter edge alone, the nest was drawn and its children dead until the
--    user wiggled out and back. So both moments ask the same question
--    geometrically, in secure code, from the same pushed parent boxes the
--    gates themselves were placed from: the press branch of SNIPPET_PRE
--    after it places them, and LeaveSnippet's disarm path after it re-shows
--    them. Both then arm through ARM_CLAIM, the same fragment a parent
--    gate's own OnEnter uses, so there is only ever one meaning of "armed".
--
--    Same-claim focus hand-off.  Moving from one of a claim's own region
--    rects to a sibling rect of the SAME claim still fires the first one's
--    OnLeave (focus left THAT frame), which is why the geometric re-test
--    exists: it finds the cursor inside the sibling rect and answers "still
--    in", so nothing is disarmed and neither rect is hidden. Nothing needs a
--    reference to any gate but its own here, because the button (eqdArmed)
--    is the only shared state -- every gate reads and writes through it.
--
--  Built and positioned only out of combat, alongside PushPalette's geometry:
--  SecureHandlerSetFrameRef and SecureHandlerWrapScript are themselves
--  ordinary insecure calls, and PushPalette already refuses to run in combat
--  for the same reason. Positioning happens in the press branch of
--  SNIPPET_PRE instead, because only that branch knows where this particular
--  press's palette actually opened.
--
--  The scroll strip's HOVER channel arms through a third shape, the LATTICE
--  (see EnsureLatticeGates): one gate per drawn strip POSITION rather than
--  per claim, because the wheel decides which slot stands at a position and
--  can change it mid-hold -- the gates hold still, resolve position -> slot
--  at enter time from the accumulator, and the wheel snippet re-derives the
--  answer for a pointer the slide moved under without any motion. Entering a
--  position that nests nothing DISARMS; the ground beside the strip touches
--  no gate and so retains, which is the sticky reach for a nest's children.

-- the whole of an open -- the floor gate covers the screen -- and a Select key
-- bound to a mouse button reaches the palette through an override binding, which
-- the client runs only when nothing under the cursor has claimed that button.
--
-- SetMouseClickEnabled(false) alone was not enough. With it, a latched menu's
-- mouse Select key did nothing for as long as any claim was armed: nested
-- entries could not be picked at all, and the next top-level entry stayed dead
-- until a retreat through the centre disarmed and took the floor gate down with
-- it. A keyboard Select key was unaffected throughout, which is what identified
-- the gates as the thing in the way. (Confirmed in game, 2026-08-11.)
--
-- So the buttons are declared not ours OUTRIGHT rather than merely left
-- unhandled: clicks are enabled, and every button is passed through. This is the
-- shape Blizzard's own map pins use to let a button reach the canvas beneath
-- them (MapCanvas_DataProviderBase.lua:288-301). SetPassThroughButtons carries
-- IsProtectedFunction, exactly like the SetMouseClickEnabled and EnableMouse
-- calls this file already makes on these same frames, and every gate is built
-- out of combat.
--
-- Without the method -- an older client -- clicks stay off, which is where this
-- began: hover-driven nesting works and a mouse Select key does not.
-- EVERY button the client knows, not the five a common mouse carries: an MMO
-- mouse reports its side buttons as BUTTON6 and up, and Blizzard names them
-- through BUTTON31 (SecureTemplates.lua:90-93). A Select key bound to one left
-- off this list is a key the gates swallow, which is the very failure the note
-- above describes.
-- Built on the first gate rather than at load: a session that never opens a
-- palette builds no gates, and this module costs nothing while switched off.

--  itself requires -- shift is down for the whole of a SHIFT- bind, and an
--  unmodified bind is only reachable with nothing held at all.
--
--  That decides what a macro fires. SECURE_ACTIONS.macro hands the name to

--  macro -- the pinned modifier state is the whole of it.
--
--  So every combination of the key is bound to the same button, and the player

-- This module has carried two names before this one -- Radial Wheel, then
-- Action Palette -- and its data has always lived in the suite's central
-- store, under the addons key NewDB derives from the saved variable name. A
-- rename therefore moves the module's home and leaves every configured
-- palette behind under an old key, invisible to the module and to profile
-- export alike. Move each profile's blob to the current key HERE, before
-- NewDB runs. A moved blob may still carry pre-rename field names (ringCount,
-- rings); P() converts those on the profile's first touch, so the raw move is
-- enough. Current data wins: a profile that already holds palette settings
-- under the current key keeps them. One blind spot: logout StripDefaults
-- leaves an all-defaults profile as an EMPTY table, which reads as "no data"
-- here, so such a profile takes a legacy blob -- once, since the old keys are
-- removed either way. That cleanup is what makes this run once, and what
-- stops the orphans riding along in every profile forever.
--
-- The old CHILD SavedVariables globals (EllesmereUIRadialWheelDB,
-- EllesmereUIActionPaletteDB) need no handling and are deliberately NOT
